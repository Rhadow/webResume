                    Long story short, I'm an engineer developing my skills on web design. I am continually growing my knowledge of the best techniques and current web-trends to ensure my designs are fresh and unique. I have a true passion for technology and would like to find a career in related area.

                <p class="longstory">
                    <strong>Short story long</strong>, I have graduated from University of Victoria majoring Electrical Engineering. After completing the military service which is required in Taiwan, I started to work as Field Application Engineer in an IC distributor company. My main job responsibility is to perform detailed review on customer's design schematic, analyze issues from customer's failed board and provided suitable solution for improvement. It is more related to hardware side but what I am really interested in is programming. Therefore, I started to learn programming language such as JAVA using my own time after work through online courses. I then self taught myself HTML5, CSS3, Javascript. As I learned these technologies, I realized that web development is a fast growing technology, it is challenging to keep up with it. However, I love challenges and I love to learn new things. Recently, I spent my most of time researching the AngularJS frame work and how to achieve responsive web design with Bootstrap 3. My ultimate goal is to be not only mastered the front-end development but also the back-end to become a fully competitive engineer in the industry!
